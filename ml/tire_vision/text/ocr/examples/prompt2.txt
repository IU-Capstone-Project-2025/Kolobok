Your task is to extract all visible text from the provided image of a tire, and also extract the tire size.
Present the extracted text as a JSON object with keys "strings" and "tire_size".
"strings" should be a list of all text strings found on the tire, and "tire_size" should be the tire size string.
Do not include any reasoning or explanations, only the final JSON object.

Example of a valid response:
{
    "strings": ["KAMA-AH35", "KAMA", "AH35", "205/85R13", "82V", "205/85R13 82V"],
    "tire_size": "175/70R13 82T"
}

You will be provided with an original image of a tire and an unwrapped image of the same tire.
Use two images to increase your accuracy.
