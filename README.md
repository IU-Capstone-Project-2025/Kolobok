Detecting tire brand, tread depth and spikes condition based on user images

## Description
Many car service centers offer tire trade-ins, but pricing used tires is slow and error-prone. It typically requires manual measurement of tread depth and a subjective evaluation of spike wear, which is not scalable.

This project uses machine learning to automate tire valuation. Users send two photos of a tire to a Telegram bot. The system then detects the brand and parameters, estimates tread depth, and analyzes the condition of spikes.

The solution is designed for both car owners and retail employees, reducing manual workload and enabling remote consultations. Developed in response to a real-world need from a mid-sized car services.
